In terms of UI, I spent a significant amount of time on the channel page, especially on the <channel-message> component that I defined. 
I added a toggle down list to the far right. Once clicked, it reveals options for message actions. 
When users edit a message, the original message gets hidden and is replaced by a textarea for users to input their message. 
This ensures that there's no noticeable shift in the <channel-message> DOM structure.

At the same time, I introduced some Bootstrap components. 
For instance, I used offline canvas for the user profile page, displayed channel details with a modal, and changed channel details.
All these enhancements aim to offer users a smoother operation and better experience.

Regarding coding style, I tried introducing custom components, particularly those related to channels. 
Admittedly, having never touched on this before, I initially spent a lot of time researching. The end result was decent, but not mature. 
This process deepened my understanding of components and gave me some exposure to object-oriented programming style. 
I wonder if this could be considered a contribution to bonus marks.
